# Project Step 2: Research statement

## Preparation

- Reflect again and refine your interest statement.
- Review the concepts and strategies for identifying a research area, problem, aim, and statement.
- Continue to comb the literature to gain a better understanding of the research area with the aim to identify a research problem and develop a research statement.

## Objectives

- Build on (and revise) your interest statement.
- Show evidence of having reviewed the literature and identified a research problem.
- Develop a research statement that aims to address this problem.

## Instructions

### Getting started

1. Clone the [project_step_2](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_step_2) repository on GitHub. Add it inside the `Workspace/` directory.
2. Create a new Quarto document called `step_2_research.qmd`, name it "Project Step 2: Research statement".
3. Remove the contents of the Quarto document so you have a blank document to work with. Save and render the document to PDF to ensure everything is working properly.
